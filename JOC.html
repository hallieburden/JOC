<p>This is my favortive project because I enjoy making slideshows, that can teach others important life knowledge. And to stop plastic pollution. Also This slideshow consists of 2-3 apps that can help reduce plastic pollution. This is a global environmental problem that needs to be stopped. This slideshow had pictures, data, and fun facts to show you the truth and how to stop this issue.

<p>This is my other fav project which is a small cookie shop, where you have a choice of 4 different cookies, classic pink sugar, chocolate chip crunch, gingerbread, and Boston cream pie. You can add any amount of cookies to your cart, and get rid of them. Then the total gets added up at the bottom. Once you press continue, it says thank you for shopping and gives you the total.
